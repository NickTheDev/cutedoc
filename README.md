# cutedoc
Cutedoc is a simple command line tool that allows you to generate beautiful static documentation using simple markdown files.
You can learn more about the project at https://nickthedev.github.io/cutedoc.

# Getting Started
If you already have Go installed, you can easily grab the latest version of Cutedoc by using the go get command in the console.
If your GOPATH/bin env variable is set, the cutedoc command will be accessible without having to specify the executable path.

```
$ go get github.com/NickTheDev/cutedoc
```
If you do not have or wish to install Go, you can grab a pre-built binary from Github. However, with this method you will have to
optionally add the executable to your env variables yourself.

# Demo
Cutedoc's documentation was created with Cutedoc, and can be found at https://nickthedev.github.io/cutedoc/docs.
