If you already have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed, you can easily grab the latest version of
Cutedoc by using the *go get* command in the console. If your GOPATH/bin env variable is set, the
cutedoc command will be accessible without having to specify the executable path.

```
$ go get github.com/NickTheDev/cutedoc
```
If you do not have or wish to install Go, you can grab a pre-built binary from
[Github](https://github.com/NickTheDev/cutedoc/releases). However, with this method you will have
to optionally add the executable to your env variables yourself.
