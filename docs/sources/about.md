We've all been there, just finishing up our awesome project, whether it be a design framework
or front-end library, and finding ourselves wondering how to create documentation for the project.
We find ourselves envying the beautiful documentation of companies like Stripe, but instead opting
out of creating custom documentation due to the amount of work it would require. Cutedoc is a simple
command line tool that can be used to solve this problem.

Using technologies that you already know and love, like github flavored markdown, you can create beautiful documentation sites
by simply creating markdown files and then stitching them together using a simple manifest file. Cutedoc leverages a high level
of *customization* through the manifest file and allows you to specify the template theme and color scheme, the logo and icon of
used, project metadata, and more.
